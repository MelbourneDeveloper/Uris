# Urls

Treat Urls as first class citizens

Urls is a .NET library of [records](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/records) that represent Urls. Unlike the [Uri](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.uri?view=net-5.0) class, all properties are immutable and there are a collection of extension methods to make Url construction easy. Use the `with` syntax to create new Urls easily, and make Http calls with [RestClient.Net](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/RestClient.Net/tree/5/develop).
